#' A Text Corpus of Articles Published in The New Europe Foreign Policy Weekly
#'
#' The `tne_articles` dataset contains a text corpus composed of full text 
#' articles published in the foreign policy weekly _The New Europe_ between 1916
#'  and 1920. The original OCR-ed text files were downloaded from the HathiTrust
#'  Digital Library. The typos were corrected, various fragments introduced by 
#' the OCR were removed. The individual individual texts of articles, 
#' their authors, and titles were then extracted into a table. This corpus 
#' provides a glimpse into thinking among the liberal European elites about 
#' the rebuilding of the postwar world after the demise of the continental 
#' empires in Europe.
