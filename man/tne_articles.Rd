\description{
The \code{tne_articles} dataset contains a text corpus composed of full text
articles published in the foreign policy weekly \emph{The New Europe} between 1916
and 1920. The original OCR-ed text files were downloaded from the HathiTrust
Digital Library. The typos were corrected, various fragments introduced by
the OCR were removed. The individual individual texts of articles,
their authors, and titles were then extracted into a table. This corpus
provides a glimpse into thinking among the liberal European elites about
the rebuilding of the postwar world after the demise of the continental
empires in Europe.
