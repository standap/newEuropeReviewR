\description{
The \code{tne_countries} dataset was created with a dictionary running against the
\code{NewEuropeWeekly} corpus using a \code{quanteda} package. Unlike regular frequency
count that simply counts how many times a token was found in the corpus,
this approach tallies multiple terms that are associated with the two-letter
country code in the dictionary file.
