  This R data package contains an R data package that
  consists of text corpus of articles from the complete run
  of the foreign policy weekly The New Europe that were
  published between 1916 and 1921. It also contains an
  additional file with frequencies of terms that are
  associated with a great number of countries mentioned on
  the pages of The New Europe weekly. The texts deal mainly
  with analysis of the war developments and the impact of
  the war on the re-making of the postwar world order. Many
  of the authors envisioned changes of political borders in
  Europe that would be more closely aligned along the ethnic
  lines. A relatively radical and unconventional view in the
  prewar Europe. The corpus reveals how was this opinion
  anchored in the prewar political theory and how this
  thinking evolved during the First World War, and impacted
  shaping of the new postwar world order at the Paris Peace
  Conference in 1919.
